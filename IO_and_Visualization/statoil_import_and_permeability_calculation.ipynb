The main problem is that the original network contains a large number of throats connecting actual internal pores to fictitious 'reservoir' pores.  OpenPNM strips away all these throats since 'headless throats' break the graph theory representation.  OpenPNM then labels the real internal pores as either 'inlet' or 'outlet' if they were connected to one of these fictitious reservoirs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is fairly simple to add a new pores to each end of the domain and stitch tehm to the internal pores labelled 'inlet' and 'outlet', but this introduces a subsequent complication that the new pores don't have any geometry properties.  For this example, we will not add boundary pores, but just the pores on the inlet and outlet faces.  "
